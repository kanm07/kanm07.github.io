                It's been a long-drawn war between two of the biggest comic franchises.
                Some MARVEL fans might be wondering why I wrote DC first and not MARVEL,
                well I prefer to compare alphabetically!

                Taking a long breath, Izzy stepped inside her sister’s living room.
                Taking in every detail of her Sister’s home she felt a sense of calm wash
                over her. She smiled, touching a picture of herself with her sister, the
                last picture that was taken before Lexi left. Running her hands through
                other pictures, most of which were paintings either bought or made by Lexi
                herself, she asked, “Do you remember your fifteenth birthday, Lexi?”
